# Settings

Open **Settings -> Community plugins -> Custom Attachment Location** to configure the plugin. Each option below lists the setting key stored in the plugin's `data.json`. Many of these accept **patterns with tokens** - see [[03 Tokens and patterns]].

## Location for new attachments

- `attachmentFolderPath` - the folder each new attachment is saved into (a pattern). Start it with `./` for a path relative to the note; otherwise it is relative to the vault root.
- `includePaths` - if non-empty, the plugin only applies within these paths.
- `excludePaths` - paths where the plugin does nothing (Obsidian's default behavior is used instead).
- `shouldCreateNoMediaFile` - when a new attachment folder is created, also create a `.nomedia` file inside it so media browsers (e.g. the Android gallery) skip scanning those attachments. Only affects folders created after enabling it.

## Attachment file naming

- `generatedAttachmentFileName` - the name pattern for a newly created attachment.
- `renamedAttachmentFileName` - the name pattern used when an attachment is renamed alongside its note.
- `shouldRenameAttachmentFiles` - rename attachment files when the note is renamed.
- `shouldRenameAttachmentFolder` - rename the per-note attachment folder when the note is renamed.
- `attachmentRenameMode` - which attachments get renamed on paste: none, only pasted images, or all.
- `duplicateNameSeparator` - the separator inserted before the counter when a name already exists (e.g. `file 1.png`).
- `specialCharacters` - characters stripped/replaced from generated folder and file names.
- `specialCharactersReplacement` - the string that replaces those special characters.

## Markdown URL

- `markdownUrlFormat` - a pattern for the link text inserted into the note. Leave blank for the default; setting it forces Markdown links even when Obsidian is configured for wikilinks.

## Link display text

- `shouldSetLinkDisplayTextToAttachmentFileName` - when inserting a link to an **attachment**, use the attachment's base name (without extension) as the link's display text. Notes are left alone, and an explicit alias or a cached image size still wins. See [[07 Link display text]].

## Custom tokens

- `customTokensStr` - JavaScript that registers your own tokens (see [[04 Custom tokens]]).

## Collecting attachments

- `shouldRenameCollectedAttachments` - rename attachments processed by the **Collect attachments** commands.
- `collectedAttachmentFileName` - the name pattern used for collected attachments.
- `collectAttachmentUsedByMultipleNotesMode` - what to do when a collected attachment is referenced by several notes: cancel, copy, move, prompt, or skip.
- `moveAttachmentToProperFolderUsedByMultipleNotesMode` - the same choice for the **Move attachment to proper folder** command.
- `excludePathsFromAttachmentCollecting` - paths ignored by the collecting commands.
- `excludePathsFromMultipleNotesCheck` - notes on these paths are ignored when deciding whether a collected attachment is used by multiple notes, so a shared embed (e.g. an `.excalidraw` drawing) does not block collecting.
- `shouldSkipCollectingAttachmentsReferencedByRawPath` - a safety net for attachments referenced by other plugins' non-standard syntaxes. When on, before collecting an attachment the plugin also scans every note's raw text for the attachment's path or file name; if a note references it in a format Obsidian does not index, the attachment is treated as still used and left in place (it is not moved or renamed). Default off. See [[05 Collect attachments]].

## Renames and deletions

- `shouldHandleRenames` - keep links and attachment folders consistent when notes are renamed or moved.
- `shouldDeleteOrphanAttachments` - delete an attachment when the note that owned it is deleted.
- `emptyFolderBehavior` - whether to keep or delete attachment folders that become empty.
- `treatAsAttachmentExtensions` - extra file extensions (like `.excalidraw.md`) treated as attachments.

## Image conversion and size

- `convertImagesToJpegMode` - convert pasted/dragged images to JPEG (none, only clipboard PNGs, all, or all except existing JPEGs).
- `jpegQuality` - the JPEG quality (0-1) used for conversion.
- `defaultImageSize` - a default size applied to inserted images (blank leaves them untouched).
- `defaultImageSizeDimension` - whether `defaultImageSize` sets the width or the height.

## Network images

- `downloadNetworkImages` - download remote images referenced in a note into the vault.
- `networkImageDownloadTimeoutInSeconds` - how long to wait for each network image download.

## Timing and bookkeeping

- `timeoutInSeconds` - timeout for the plugin's longer operations (0 means wait indefinitely).
- `version` - the settings schema version; managed by the plugin, not edited by hand.
